# Assignment 3

This assignment had two parts. 

## Part 1

The first part was to implement power operation (in C) in three ways:

1. Iterative way.
2. Recursive way.
3. Efficient recursive way - using the formula 𝑥^𝑦 = 𝑥^(𝑦/2) * 𝑥^(𝑦/2)

## Part 2

The second part was about arrays. We had to implement a function that gets two arrays and their dimension and to check if one is a permutation of the other.

## Note
The file ass3.c is the implementation and the main.c is only a driver/test code.
