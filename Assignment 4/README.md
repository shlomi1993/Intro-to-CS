# Assignment 4 - Chess Game

This assignment was a bigger step into coding in relation to the previous assignments.
In this assignment we had to implement the logic of chess game in C.

## Methods

We used two methods:
1. FEN method -- a method to describe board-status with strings.
2. PGN method -- a method to describe the course of the game.

## Challenge

From a current prospective this assignment look very easy and the attached implementation maybe looks a little messy, but back than it was the most difficult task of the semester for most students, for several reasons:

1. We were pretty new to programming in general and to C in particular.

2. We couldn't split the code to different files because one of  the lessons of this task is the importance of Seperation-of-Concerns principle, and it was a teaser to OOP course in the next semester.

3. This was the first time we had to use pointers and to deal with memory.

## Examples

Here is an example if FEN method:

Here is an example of the game board:
