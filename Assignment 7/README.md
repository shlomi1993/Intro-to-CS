# Assignment 7 - Crawler

In this assignment we implemented a very basic Web Crawler with Python.

A Crawler is a piece of code that "crawl" from one link in the Web to another and by that it scans part of the network/internet.

This implementation of crawler is very basic because the idea behind the assignment is to examine how students deal with programming in a new language, different from what they were taught during the semester.

To be honest it was a nice assignment but far less challenging than assignments 4 (chess) and 6 (dictionary).
